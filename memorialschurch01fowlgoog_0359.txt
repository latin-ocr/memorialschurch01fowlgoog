REPORT FOR THE YEAR MCMVII.

Smcn the issue ol the last Report two volumes have been
issued, and the one for the present year is passihg through
the presS. Of these two volumes the earlier is a continuation

of Wills arrd Inventories‚ the second part of which appeared ’

iu 1860, under the editorship of the Rev. William Greenwell.
Mr. J. Crawford Hodgson, the editor ol the third part, has
followed Mr. Greenwell's example in giving a considerable

g number of Inventories, from which so much information can

be gathered as t0 the civilization and wealth in the two
Northern Counties at the close of the Seventeenth Century.
Examples of the wills and inventories of persons of the lower

middle clasS, such as yeomen aud shopkeepers, very much

enhance the value of the volume. ’

In the Records of the Northern -Convocation the Dean
of Durham, Dr. Kitchin‚ has guthered a large mass of infor·
mation concerning a body which, till quite modern times,
was entirely eclipsed by its more important sister iu the
Southern Province. In his Introduction the Editor gives a
very interesting history of the fortunes of this institution
from the beginning of the Fourteenth Century till its revival
some sixty years ago.

As no lewer than four volumes are now passing through
the press it is hoped that during the coming year the publi-
catious of the Society may be brought up to date. Of these
the Percy Chartulary contains documentS, many of early date,
