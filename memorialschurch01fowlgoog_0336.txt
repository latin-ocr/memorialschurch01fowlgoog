¹This equestrian statue was 116 doubt intended to adorn the
chapel 61161161 St. Georgo in the Minster, in connexion with which a
chantry was to have been founded. But as no such chantry appears
in the chentry certificateS, the intention 61 the founder cannot have
been carried out. Brian Batty made provision 16111111 hiswill in
1515. This will was proved in 1520 (Mem. Rip.. I, 331, 332), and a
foundation charter was sealed by John Radclyff and Ralph, son 61
Briau Batty‚ in 1521 (Mem. Rip. Ι, 181).
