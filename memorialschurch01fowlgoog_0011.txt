PREFACE.

...ιι-...-

MY attention was first directed to what we now call
the lngilby Manuscript by a letter from Mrs. Tempest,
dated Broughton Hall, Skipton, Yorkshire‚ Π April,
1904. This lady rightly surmised that I did not know
of the MS. when I edited the “ Memorials of Ripon '' for
the Surtees Society. lt had, no doubt, belonged to the
Library at Ripley Castle at one time, but had somehow
come into the possession of a lady whose executors sold
it to William Ingilby, Esq.‚ of 22, Bolton Street, Mayfair,
brother of Sir Henry D. Ingilby, the present owner of
Ripley. Mr. lngilby most k'indly placed the MS. in
my hands for as long as was necessary, that l might
copy it for the Surtees Society, the Council of which
Society at once agreed that it should be edited by me
as a fourth volume of “ Memorials of Ripon.’' The
MS. is about twelve inches by nine in size, and is of a
somewhat complex nature, consisting as it does of parts

’ of Act Books of the Chapter of Ripon, together with
a considerable fragment of a Ripon cartulary of the ’

fourteenth century. The contents of these two distinct

portions are particularized in the table that follows this

preface, and it will be seen that they are highly valuable ’
reeords, saved, most fortunately‚ from the general wreck

in the sixteenth century. It would seem as if some one, ⁸
seeing them thrown about as worthless, had caused them
to be put together in a single volume in order to preserve
at least a few specimens of the great mass of manuscript
material then dispersed and destroyed for ever. It is
not unlikely that the person who did this good work
of preservation was one of the Ingilby family or one
