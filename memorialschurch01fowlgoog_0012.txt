The Chapter Acts here printed for the first time
include a great many institutions of canons, vicars, and
others, which add several new names to those in the
Fasti Riponienses in our second volume. Among these
are no less than fourteen names of canons not previously
known, viz.: John de Clifford, upon whose death in or
before 1393 William de Cawood was admitted to the
prebend of Thorp; F ranciscus presbyter Cardinalis tituli
iiij0r coronatorum, admitted to the prebend of Monkton
about 1411; John de Columba, who had held a
prebend before c. 1233i Peter de Fikelden‚ who held
a prebend that had been held by Will. de Orliens‚
c. 1228-1234; T. de G., concanonicus, 1306-1352;
Adam de Melsenby, witness 1228 and c. 1235; Milo,

witness in twelfth century; Rob. Passelew, 1216-124ο;
Adam de Pinkon', or Pinkneyg, or Pinkeni, e. 1270,
(misread Pynhou in Dambrough MS.); Will. Romanus
witness 1233, 12345 Will. fil. Stephani, witness
c. 1233 ; TurstinuS, witness 1114-114o; Alan de
Wassant, c„ 1242 ; Ric. de Yarom, witness c. 1230
and c. 1234. Besides these new names, we gather
several new dates and particulars belonging to canons
already known, and many hitherto unknown appoint-
ments of vicars and other officers of the church.

. Documents already printed in these Memorials are not

reprinted here, but any notable variations are given,
including some corrections of names before printed from
the Dambrough Ms, where they were incorrectly copied.
